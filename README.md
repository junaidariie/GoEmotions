# GoEmotions Emotion Detector (BiLSTM)

▶️ **Live App:** https://YOUR_APP_LINK_HERE

This project is a **multi-label emotion classification system** trained on the
Google Research **GoEmotions dataset**, capable of detecting **28 different emotions**
from text, including:

Joy, Love, Anger, Fear, Gratitude, Surprise, Neutral, and more.
